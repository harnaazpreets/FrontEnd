    <h1>OkapiLib 5</h1>
    <p>A maintainance fork of <a href="https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib">OkapiLib</a>, a PROS library for programming VEX V5 robots. 
    Due to the widespread use of the library, we at the PROS team are working to maintain it so that it continues to
    work with future versions of PROS.</p>
    <p>This library is intended to raise the floor for teams
    with all levels of experience. New teams should have an easier time getting their robot up and
    running, and veteran teams should find that OkapiLib doesn't get in the way or place any limits on
    functionality.</p>
    <p>OkapiLib documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages
    <a href="https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/index.html">here</a>.
    PROS documentation is hosted on the Purdue site
    <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5">here</a>.</p>
